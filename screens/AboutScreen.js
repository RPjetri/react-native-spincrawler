In a polarized world and political climate, we hope that visitors find the organization of stories useful to dissecting the perspective of particular data sources and newsrooms. We give people a comprehensive and inclusive summary of topics they'd like to search.

Curbing confirmation bias is our mission and we will continually strive to do better given the technology provided to us.
